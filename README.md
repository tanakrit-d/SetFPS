This mod allows you to dynamically set the target FPS of Balatro, without having to manually edit the value of `FPS_CAP` in `main.lua`.  

If you're experiencing high battery drain or increased thermals while playing - this is likely the solution as the default value is `500`.

## Options

In order to select your desired FPS, navigate to `Options → Settings → Video`.

Available FPS caps: `30`, `60`, `120`, `144`, `240`, `Max (500)`.

There's no need to press apply - the settings are saved immediately.
